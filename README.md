 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Owen's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I embarked on my coding journey at the age of 14, initially working with Wordpress. Driven by my fascination with technology and computers, I spent my after-school hours either exploring Unity game tutorials or managing my Xbox games-focused Wordpress blog. Intrigued by marketing and online income opportunities, I ventured into creating a Wordpress website where I discussed new Xbox games and experimented with incorporating ads to generate revenue. Although I aspired to make significant profits, my age posed a limitation as linking a bank account required individuals over 18 years old. Additionally, I pursued my passion for robotics and Raspberry Pi projects, successfully developing a rudimentary "security system" utilizing a Raspberry Pi and motion sensor.

    To further enhance my skills, my parents enrolled me in a Btech coding summer camp, where I gained foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This experience not only sparked my interest but also provided me with practical insights into computer science as it applies to real-world job scenarios. Motivated by my newfound curiosity, I pursued higher education after high school, enrolling in Bridgerland Technical College. There, I obtained a certificate in Web and Mobile Development, expanding my knowledge and refining my skills in these areas.
